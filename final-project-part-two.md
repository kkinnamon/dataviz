# Wireframes / storyboards
Part two of the final project was drafted directly in storyboard: https://preview.shorthand.com/gLeeYnGYP6WgZslF. Feedback that I'm seeking or items that I'm still troubleshooting are italicized in the text.


# User research 

## Target audience
The target audience is two tiered. The first, and ultimately the reason why I created this visualization, was to help guide aspiring teachers to areas that might appeal to them in ways beyond livable cities, trendy neighborhoods, and signing bonuses. By connecting with college students, I hope they would feel equiped to seek districts that align with their personal and career goals.

As a second tier, I hope to appeal to the parents and voters. Armed with information about what teachers in their state face, they may feel compelled to support public school teachers in different ways and advocate for changes within the local school district.

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|   goals   |    What do you think I'm trying to achieve through this story?              |
|   clarity   |    What are the graphs telling you? Are there portions of the graph that made you pause, and not because you were thinking about the data?              |
|   access   |    Is the information easy to navigate? Are there words/phrases that left you unsure?              |

I'm hopeful that while interviewing, I'll be able to identify if the audience could understand my goals, and if they were able to view the story in a clear, accessible way. My first goal is just that, is the goal defined. Is the audience able to see the connection across the visualizations and to themselves or do they view the visualizations as separate entities that happen to be placed within one story.

The remaining goals of clarity and access focus on elements within the visualizations and their content. Clarity focuses on the visualizations, whereas access eliminates bias in my language in both the visualizations and the surrounding narratives. As a U.S. citizen who is a former school teacher, there is the potential for assumed language understanding, and I want to avoid that.
