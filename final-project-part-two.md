# Wireframes / storyboards
Part two of the final project was drafted directly in shorthand: https://preview.shorthand.com/gLeeYnGYP6WgZslF. Feedback that I'm seeking or items that I'm still troubleshooting are italicized in the text.


# User research 

## Target audience
The target audience is two tiered. The first, and ultimately the reason why I created this visualization, was to help guide aspiring teachers to areas that might appeal to them in ways beyond livable cities, trendy neighborhoods, and signing bonuses. By connecting with college students, I hope they would feel equiped to seek districts that align with their personal and career goals.

As a second tier, I hope to appeal to the parents and voters. Armed with information about what teachers in their state face, they may feel compelled to support public school teachers in different ways and advocate for changes within the local school district.

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|   goals   |    What do you think I'm trying to achieve through this story?              |
|   clarity   |    What are the graphs telling you? Are there portions of the graph that made you pause, and not because you were thinking about the data?              |
|   access   |    Is the information easy to navigate? Are there words/phrases that left you unsure?              |

I'm hopeful that while interviewing, I'll be able to identify if the audience could understand my goals, and if they were able to view the story in a clear, accessible way. My first goal is just that, is the goal defined. Is the audience able to see the connection across the visualizations and to themselves or do they view the visualizations as separate entities that happen to be placed within one story.

The remaining goals of clarity and access focus on elements within the visualizations and their content. Clarity focuses on the visualizations, whereas access eliminates bias in my language in both the visualizations and the surrounding narratives. As a U.S. citizen who is a former school teacher, there is the potential for assumed language understanding, and I want to avoid that.

## Interview findings

| Questions               | Interview 1- Full-time Heinz Student Group | Interview 2- Coworker with higher education background | Interview 3- Family member who is not an educator but works with school aged students |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| How can I elements more visually appealing? | Have you tried changing the axis on any visualizations you're struggling with? It might make it more accessible/user friendly.            | There's a lot to the map that means nothing. Can you zoom in? | The story is an afterthought. Am I supposed to read that too? Maybe highlight or bold important text. |
|  Are there definitions that need clarified? | I'm confused about what teacher means. Does that mean professor? Can you explain underqualified? It sounds important, but I need that information to understand the visualization.  |  All of the info makes sense! |   Why does underqualified matter? |
|  Any visualization updates that come to mind? |  Visualizations make sense for the data you're sharing.  Great use of variety. Do you always need to include all of the states? |   |  Just the map question from before. | The text is small. Is there a way to make it bigger? |


# Identified changes for Part III

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Update visualizations that over communicate | This mostly impacts the underqualified and average salary visualizations. I'll look for opportunities to show ranges versuses the whole dataset, and link out to my github page for those who want more information. |
|  Definitions, definitions, definitions |  This may be specific to my narrative, but may impact titles, subtitles, and labels. I'm going to review the story to find any opportunity to clarify. |
|  Eliminate gray space |  As is, the map has too much gray space. I'll update the map to focus on the lower 48.             |
