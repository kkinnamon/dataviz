# The final data story

# Changes made since Part II
My visualizations from part II to part III stayed in the same style, but they were tightened up a bit for clarity. For example, rather than a large amount of gray space on the first map, I zoomed into the lower 48. While I wanted the audience to see the differences between the total number of teachers across the state, I knew that the main premise would be lost when they had to continue scrolling. 

I knew that the information was valuable, but maybe not for everyone. To fix this, I worked them into my call to action portion. Shortened versions of the visualizations occur throughout the story while the originals with all 50 states (plus DC) are linked at the end of the story. As a part of the call to action, the audience is encouraged to continue their research in states important to them, and feel empowered as they take the data into an interview. This allows the audience to connect with what is pertinent to them and take action based on their personal goals and needs.

When it comes to design, I wanted to keep the story visually light to contrast the heavy topic. I also wanted to subtly lean into the colors from the opening screen. I struggled a bit with colors for the visualizations, especially the maps due to the wide ranges in results. In the end, I think I made appropriate decisions, but it was a lot of second guessing.

## The audience
The audience is ultimately aspiring teachers as the visualizations and story were written with them in mind. The secondary audience could include their families, policy makers, and those who have a stake in the success of public educators. That should include everyone, but that's a conversation for a different day.

## AI acknowledgements
I referenced chatgpt to add a 50 state reference line in the Top10/Bottom 10 visualization. While I was working through this visualization, the average line would change if I filtered the states shown, but I wanted to line to show the national average. I prompted chatgpt to walk me through creating a filter to keep the average static, which I think is incredibly impactful. 

# Final thoughts
This processed pushed my thinking in tremendous ways. I had to prioritize my goals and decide when to push forward with an idea and when to scale back due to my technical limitations. I'm very proud of the final outcome and what I was able to achieve.
