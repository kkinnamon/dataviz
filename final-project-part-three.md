## AI acknowledgements
I referenced chatgpt to add a 50 state reference line in the Top10/Bottom 10 visualization. While I was working through this visualization, the average line would change if I filtered the states shown, but I wanted to line to show the national average. I prompted chatgpt to walk me through creating a filter to keep the average static.
